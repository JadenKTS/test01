<h2>Message from the Commissioner</h2>
<h3>DARS to Provide Employees with Credit Monitoring Services</h3>

<p>On June 10, DARS began notifying up to 4,900 current and former employees that their names and Social Security numbers may have been exposed in a data security breach.</p>

<p><strong>What Happened</strong><br />
  The DARS commissioner received notice just after 2 p.m. June 9 that a list of employee names and Social Security numbers dated July 2010 could be accessed on a public internet site. DARS took immediate steps to have the information removed from the website and ensure that there were no other ways to inappropriately access the information. The agency also notified the Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC).  The HHSC Office of Inspector General is now investigating the incident, which also has been reported to law enforcement.</p>

<p><strong>Who Was Affected</strong><br />
  Employees who worked for DARS, the former Texas Rehabilitation Commission, the Commission for the Blind or the Commission for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing may have had their personal information exposed. Employees hired after July 2010 are not affected by this incident.</p>

<p><strong>What Happens Next</strong><br />
  On Tuesday, DARS is sending letters to all current and former employees whose names and Social Security numbers may have been exposed.  The letters will include information about how to sign up for a year of credit monitoring services, including $25,000 of personal identity coverage. DARS will pay for this service. Affected employees will receive a personalized code that allows them to sign up for the coverage.  By Wednesday of this week, a call center and website will be operating for current and former employees who have questions about steps they can take to protect their identities.</p>

<p>DARS also is encouraging affected employees to sign up for a free 90-day credit fraud alert by contacting any one of the three major national credit bureaus and requesting a fraud alert. This typically takes just a few moments to complete. You may contact one of the national credit bureaus at: </p>
