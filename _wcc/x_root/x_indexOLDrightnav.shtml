<h3>New DARS Initiative to Increase Awareness of Disabilities and History of the Disability Rights Movement</h3>

<p>DARS Commissioner Debra Wanser has announced that DARS is beginning a year-long effort to increase awareness of disabilities and encourage understanding of the disability rights movement. The agency&#8217;s initiative supports the newly designated Persons with Disabilities History and Awareness Month (October), which the 82nd Texas Legislature created in House Bill 3616. The DARS Web site <a href="/disability/index.shtml">Disabilities History and Awareness page</a> will feature regularly updated information about a variety of disability issues, a historical overview of how people with disabilities have achieved independence and equality, and a calendar of disability events around the state and other observances. Every month, we will turn our attention to a different disability and the programs the agency provides to help Texans with that disability. DARS is committed to providing quality services to people with disabilities and families with children who have developmental delays. We invite you to join us in celebrating their accomplishments and successes throughout the coming year.</p>

	    <p>The Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services, or DARS, administers programs that ensure Texas is a state 
	      where people with disabilities, and children who have developmental delays, enjoy the same opportunities as other 
	      Texans to live independent and productive lives.</p>
	    <p>The department has four divisions:</p>
	    <ul>
          <li><a href="/drs/index.shtml">Rehabilitation Services</a></li>
	      <li><a href="/dbs/index.shtml">Blind Services</a></li>
	      <li><a href="/ecis/index.shtml">Early Childhood Intervention Services</a></li>
	      <li><a href="/services/dds.shtml">Disability Determination Services</a></li>
        </ul>
<p>Through these divisions, DARS administers programs that help Texans with disabilities find jobs through vocational rehabilitation, ensure that Texans with disabilities live independently in their communities, and assist families in helping their children under age 3 with disabilities and delays in development reach their full potential.</p>

<p>It is a fundamental value of DARS to listen, to learn, and to be responsive to our stakeholders and our consumers in an ongoing effort to make programs and services even better.  If you have suggestions or comments, please call the 	      DARS Inquiries Unit at 1-800-628-5115, or email <a href="mailto:DARS.Inquiries@dars.state.tx.us">DARS.Inquiries@dars.state.tx.us</a></p>
